                                    which activates a promoter for the luciferase gene by binding to a G-protein coupled
                                    cascade and therefore leads to the expression of luciferin. A probe can be tested
                                    hereby and the results can be analysed qualitative (by detect light activation) or
                                    qualitative (by spectrometry). We received a silver medal in the discipline
                                    Environment for this project.

                                    rarest blood type for donating is blood type zero, which is not always available.
                                    Therefore we developed the T-ECO system (Tübingen erythrocyte converter to 0),
                                    which modifies the glycolised protein chains of antigenes on erythrocytes of blood
                                    type A, B and AB in a way that they adopt the behavior of blood type zero cells. As
                                    proof for successful transformation serves a simple agglutination test. For this
                                    project we received the bronze medal in the discipline Health & Medicine.

                                <td>Analysis and imaging methods are an indispensable element of every scientific study
                                    - in a wider sense the results are only as good as their measurement methods are.
                                    Photostimulation is one of the most important non-invasive analysis methods existing
                                    which allows researches to examine the relationship between metabolic processes,
                                    e.g. through activating a molecule via light treatment. What we wanted to do is to
                                    create a module in which we can do a snapshot of the activity of a sensor at any
                                    time.
                                    For caging we use Dronpa, a fluorescent protein. Dronpa is able to dimerise at 400nm
                                    and monomerises again at 500nm. Therefore it can be used reversibly for caging an
                                    enzyme. If an amino- and carboxy-terminus bound Dronpa dimerises, it will cover the
                                    active site of the enzyme and inactivates it this way.
                                    To proof a successful activation of the enzyme a reporter is necessary. The
                                    Cre-recombinase suits well for this. Cre can be inserted into the DNA permanently as
                                    a sensor and is able to be controlled by light if bound to Dronpa. When activated,
                                    it can lead to the expression of an GFP gene construct, which is easily proofable
                                    due to its fluorescence.
                                    This module could be used with a variety of associated enzymes and proteins to
                                    light-dependently controll these.

                                <td>In 2016 we got three projects, as our team is growing constantly. The first project
                                    is about the development of a method to help people suffering fructose intolerance,
                                    by
                                    designing the lactobacilli which live in your digestive tract to process the
                                    fructose.
                                    The second project is an investigation in the hardware-track of iGEM: A pipetting
                                    robot, which is able to do the cloning experiments required in our main project.
                                    Last but not least, we faced the problem of plasmid extraction in a robot, so we
                                    developed a simple way to easily select and purify
                                    transformed plasmid DNA.

                                    The rising amount of microbial resistances urge for innovation and new therapeutics.
                                    Many substances already available in the lab are potent as antibiotics but cannot be
                                    used in humans due to toxicity or problems in delivery. Therefore, we used
                                    aminocoumarins and created a new derivative via a semi-biosynthetic synthesis
                                    approach. The introduction of specific modifications changes the pattern of
                                    interaction with proteins while also improving the chemical properties of
                                    aminocoumarins. Our modification specifically targets ß-lactam resistant pathogens.
                                    For proof of principle, we developed a suitable test system consisting of an
                                    E.coli-based pathogen model and a toxicity assay. Additionally, we performed an in
                                    silico prediction of changes in binding affinity to target proteins. In conclusion,
                                    we created an antibiotic that is only activated by ß-lactam resistant pathogens
                                    itself via enzymatic cleavage while not affecting other cells in the human body -
                                    the advanced Trojan horse is set free.

                                    In modern medicine treatment options involve many substances modified from natural
                                    sources, occasionally even toxins. We modify botulinum toxin in a way that leads to
                                    its detoxification. Thus, it can be coupled with a variety of other substances while
                                    not losing its specific shuttle mechanism for neuronal cells. In detail, we develop
                                    a library of different detoxified botulinum toxin derivatives which can accommodate
                                    other proteins, small molecules, and fluorochromes by specific linkers. To
                                    investigate the influence of the point mutations leading to detoxification in the
                                    active site, we conduct MD simulations. Since our shuttle mechanism could
                                    potentially be used in patients, we remove the most prevalent immune epitopes by a
                                    theoretical bioinformatics approach. Ultimately, our system is supposed to be
