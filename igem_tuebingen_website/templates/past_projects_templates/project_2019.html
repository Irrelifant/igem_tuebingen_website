        {{ _('Type II Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disease that affects about 10 percent of the population.
        One
        of its major symptoms is the relative lack of insulin, which causes a decreased uptake of glucose into
        cells, leading to an energy crisis. In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the body compensates this
        relative lack of insulin by secreting more insulin, which causes stress for insulin producing
        beta cells of the pancreas. This increased stress will, in the end, lead to the destruction of the beta
        cells, leaving the body with an absolute lack of insulin, making insulin substitution necessary.
        In Type II Diabetes Mellitus the relative lack of insulin can have multiple reasons. It can be
        induced by overconsumption of sugar-containing food, decreasing the sensitivity of the Insulin
        Receptors, as they are downregulated. But it can also have genetic reasons, such as a mutation
        in an essential gene etc.
        A form of treatment for Type II Diabetes Mellitus are incretin mimetics. Incretin mimetics copy
        the incretin effect of incretins such as Glucagon Like Peptide 1. This is the explanation for the
        fact that oral uptake causes a bigger release of insulin, than the parenteral uptake.
        Glucagon like peptide 1, produced in the L-cells of the intestine, is secreted upon nutrient
        availability, and reaches the pancreas through the bloodstream. There it will bind its receptor
        (a G-protein coupled receptor), which will activate Adenylate Cyclase (if ATP is available within
        the cell), initiating the production of cAMP. Overall, this will lead to increased Calcium Ion
        influx, allowing for more Insulin to be secreted from the beta cells. This increased secretion will help
        overcome a relative lack of insulin in Type II Diabetes Mellitus, if the amount of incretins
        secreted is sufficient.') }}

        CRISPR/Cas9 (or similar) technology has become a versatile toolkit for gene editing in all domains of life.
        Despite of the successes, off-target activities can be observed in many cases.
        These off-target activities lead to unwanted genome alterations when non-homologous end
        joining machineries are available in the system of interest, and therefore have to be considered in every
        experiment.
        To facilitate the analysis of experimental off-target identification, we will create a data analysis pipeline
        for
        GUIDE-Seq and CIRCLE-Seq experiments to identify off-target sites in CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.
        Our goal is to generate a reproducible and parallelizable analysis software tool, based on the bioinformatics
        workflow management system Nextflow.
        To us, creating an easy-to-use software tool is of highest priority.
        Thus, we are creating a clear and comprehensible graphical user interface.
        We plan to improve the existing workflow layout by replacing single components to improve the accuracy of the
        result,
        and to reduce the computational time needed. Furthermore, we will validate the results of our workflow
        experimentally,
